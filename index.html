    <p class="lead">
    In an age where everything we do interacts with the internet in one way or another, how much of our personal information do we put onto the internet?
    </p>
    <p>
    Almost everything we do, every day, uses the internet in some way. Especially in this age, where physical interaction is risky, where we depend on the internet to interact, what does the internet depend on us for?
    </p>
    <p>
    You might have answered with the normal things. Sure, it depends on us to give it room. It depends on us to keep it running. To provide it with power, with storage, with servers. With IP addresses, DNS servers, domains. But what about the services that run the internet? Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple. The biggest tech giants of the modern day. Countless people depend on these companies every day to keep their lives running. But what about the companies? Do they depend on us?
    </p>
    <p>
    Well, yes they do. Without users, every company will eventually reach bankruptcy. Without money, a company cannot sustain itself. These tech giants are the same. Even billions in the bank will eventually get exhusted. It needs to be sustained. They need to make a profit. And this is where things get problematic.
    </p>
    <p>
    You see, the primary way moneymakers of these giants, and most online services, revolves around advertisements. Now, advertisements are fine. Companies have to make money. And users don't want to pay for services. So, ads work. However, what these ads have evolved into is where the problem begins. It starts with them becoming even more intrusive. Websites, especially ones that provide content for the user to read, such as news websites, have increasingly intrusive advertisements. Many sites have tons of advertisements, banners, videos, preventing the user from accessing what they want, the content. It gets to the point where it's almost impossible to just read what you want to read without an adblock, and getting prompted to sign up for mailing lists 20 times. And it gets worse, sites using services that block adblock. But where does this coincide with privacy? Well, that's the next step in the hell of a rabbit hole that is advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because the next step is where things start to go downhill. This is when companies, especially Google, realized that <em>personalized</em> advertisements could be deployed. Personalized advertisements, as the name suggests, allows companies to show advertisements relevant to the user. Why would they do this? Profit. By selling personalized advertising, they could get clients to pay more, to show their ads to the audience intended. But, how do they know who to show it to? This is the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    The problem arises here. In order to personalize their advertisements, they needed information to personalize with. So, the only solution was to start tracking users. See where they went, what they liked. What links they clicked on, what posts they liked, what videos they watched, what they searched, what ads they clicked on. This is also what made cookies so controversial. You might have heard of them, the internet variety, not the ones you get out of the oven. The reason they are so controversial, is because of this personalized advertisements. Embedded ads on websites could set cookies, allowing services, especially Google's AdSense, to track you. Google's AdSense has taken off. Almost every site with ads that you'll see will use AdSense. It's on YouTube, news sites, everywhere. You'll be able to tell an advertisement is using AdSense because you'll have that familier "Why this ad?" button.
    </p>
    <p>
    The amount of information that these sites track is completely ignored by most people. In fact, you can go to <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">Google Ad Settings</a> to see stereotypes Google thinks you follow.
