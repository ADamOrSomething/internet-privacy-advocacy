      Internet Privacy Matters

    <h3 class="display-3" id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    In an age where everything we do interacts with the internet in one way or another, how much of our personal information do we put onto the internet?
    </p>
    <p>
    Almost everything we do, every day, uses the internet in some way. Especially in this age, where physical interaction is risky, where we depend on the internet to interact, what does the internet depend on us for?
    </p>
    <p>
    You might have answered with the normal things. Sure, it depends on us to give it room. It depends on us to keep it running. To provide it with power, with storage, with servers. With IP addresses, DNS servers, domains. But what about the services that run the internet? Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple. The biggest tech giants of the modern day. Countless people depend on these companies every day to keep their lives running. But what about the companies? Do they depend on us?
    </p>
    <p>
    Well, yes they do. Without users, every company will eventually reach bankruptcy. Without money, a company cannot sustain itself. These tech giants are the same. Even billions in the bank will eventually get exhusted. It needs to be sustained. They need to make a profit. And this is where things get problematic.
    </p>
    <p>
    You see, the primary way moneymakers of these giants, and most online services, revolves around advertisements. Now, advertisements are fine. Companies have to make money. And users don't want to pay for services. So, ads work. However, what these ads have evolved into is where the problem begins. It starts with them becoming even more intrusive. Websites, especially ones that provide content for the user to read, such as news websites, have increasingly intrusive advertisements. Many sites have tons of advertisements, banners, videos, preventing the user from accessing what they want, the content. It gets to the point where it's almost impossible to just read what you want to read without an adblock, and getting prompted to sign up for mailing lists 20 times. And it gets worse, sites using services that block adblock. But where does this coincide with privacy? Well, that's the next step in the hell of a rabbit hole that is advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because the next step is where things start to go downhill. This is when companies, especially Google, realized that <em>personalized</em> advertisements could be deployed. Personalized advertisements, as the name suggests, allows companies to show advertisements relevant to the user. Why would they do this? Profit. By selling personalized advertising, they could get clients to pay more, to show their ads to the audience intended. But, how do they know who to show it to? This is the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    The problem arises here. In order to personalize their advertisements, they needed information to personalize with. So, the only solution was to start tracking users. See where they went, what they liked. What links they clicked on, what posts they liked, what videos they watched, what they searched, what ads they clicked on. This is also what made cookies so controversial. You might have heard of them, the internet variety, not the ones you get out of the oven. The reason they are so controversial, is because of this personalized advertisements. Embedded ads on websites could set cookies, allowing services, especially Google's AdSense, to track you. Google's AdSense has taken off. Almost every site with ads that you'll see will use AdSense. It's on YouTube, news sites, everywhere. You'll be able to tell an advertisement is using AdSense because you'll have that familier "Why this ad?" button.
    </p>
    <p>
    The amount of information that these sites track is completely ignored by most people. In fact, you can go to <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">Google Ad Settings</a> to see stereotypes Google thinks you follow.
    </p>

    <h3 class="display-3" id="why-is-it-important">Why is it so important?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    Now, it's more important than ever. Would you give a stranger on the street the information these companies collect on you?
    </p>
    <p>
    Your approximate location, what you like, your hobbies, when you use the internet, when you don't, what you do for work. Would you give that to someone random? The answer is probably no, unless you really don't value privacy, in which case you might as well stop reading. If the answer was no, then why are you giving it out to these large companies, just so they can make a profit? You shouldn't be, and they shouldn't have the right to do this. Unfortunately, they do. And that's the problem. Millions of people use these services, oblivious to what's being collected about them. Stored on hard disks in huge server rooms with black boxes, buzzing 24/7, reading and writing data about hundreds of thousands of individuals, hundreds of thousands of accounts. Terabyte after terabyte of data, all used to increase their profit. This shouldn't be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
    You don't want your information on spinning hard drives in huge server rooms, do you? You probably don't want your personal information anywhere on the internet without your explicit authorization. And here rises another problem. You gave your authorization. If you've signed up for an account for a service on the internet, you probably remember those checkboxes that asked you to agree to the "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy". I bet you didn't read those, did you? The problem is, no one really does. Which is why companies take advantage of them. The fact that no one reads them allows them to straight up put things in there, like collecting your personal information.
    </p>

    <h3 class="display-3" id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    Short answer: practically nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
    You might be thinking: "Yeah, this is a pretty big issue. People are doing things, right?" Well, not exactly. Since I'm in the US, let's focus on the United States government first. Now, the US government is very distributed, to prevent abuse of power. There are a lot of different positions, protocols, parties. Now, because there are so many people, it's hard to pass laws. You need the backing of the majority, which can be quite difficult to acquire. The second issue here, is, for lack of better terminology, most politicians don't particularly understand technology the best. Now, there are the outliers here and there, ones that are proposing solutions. However, others aren't. For example, earlier this year Senate proposed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text">EARN IT</a> bill. The label on the box top is
    <blockquote class="blockquote">To establish a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention, and for other purposes.</blockquote>
    However, the bill does much more than that, which is pretty well stated in "and for other purposes". Now if you want a much more detailed explanation, I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/new-earn-it-bill-still-threatens-encryption-and-free-speech">EFF's article on it</a>. In a nutshell, it gives government the ability to selectively revoke Section 230's immunities. Section 230 is what allows internet platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and others to work the way they do. It allows these companies, and more, to not be responsible for what the users put on the platform. For example, if someone posts illegal content on a blog website, Section 230 allows the blog website to not be responsible. Now, if this were revoked, I'm sure you could see the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the positive side, sites like <a href="https://eff.org">EFF</a> are attempting to raise awareness for this issue. However, without significant backing or awareness, it's quite a steep uphill battle. And not nearly well enough.
    </p>

    <h3 class="display-3" id="what-can-i-do">So what can I do?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    Raise awareness. Turn off tracking. Depend on these companies less.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now, probably the best thing you can do is to raise awareness for this issue. Tell your family, friends, anyone who cares. And most people probably will. Write to your representatives. Exercise your right to petition. Your right to assembly. This is an issue that's rising the more we depend on technology, which is happening more and more every day.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can also help yourself against this. Educate yourself with websites like <a href="https://eff.org">EFF</a>. Turn off tracking and telemetry where you can. You can do this for <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization">Google</a>, <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.techpout.com/how-to-disable-telemetry-and-data-collection-in-windows-10/">Windows 10</a>, and many more. You can switch to more privacy respecting products and services, like <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a> or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> instead of Google Chrome, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> instead of Google, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> instead of Microsoft Office, and if you're feeling particularly adventurous, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> instead of Windows.

    If you've read this far, good on you. Hopefully you can leave this page feeling a bit more educated, a bit more ready, a bit more anonymous. I know that was a lot of words and text, without too much else. Sorry about the lack of pictures, didn't really know what to show ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Have a great rest of your day, night, morning, afternoon, evening, whatever time it may be. - Adam
